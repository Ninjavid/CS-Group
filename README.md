## 3D Chess
A chess game like the one from Star Trek. The game might work by your pawns being able to move one dimention or to move normaly. We'll change parts of how the game is played as me make it.

## Atomic Chess
Everything goes kaboom whenever you attack someone. Pawns are safe in explosions and your piece is sacrifised when you attack with it. To win you have to kill the king in a explosion. (The explosions are 3x3 not 9x9 like the image says)
